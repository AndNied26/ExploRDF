						This web application is made for visualizing <i>RDF</i> Graphs (<i>Resource Description Framework</i>).
						<br>
						The following guideline will try to help you to get used to the application and solve some
						of the occurred questions.
					</p>
				</div>


				<div class="imageDiv">
					<h5>Connecting to a <i>RDF</i> Triple Store</h5>

					<p>First of all you have to connect to a <i>RDF</i> Triple Store. Therefore you need to fill in the form at
						the <a href="connect">Connect</a> site.
						<br>
						You can choose between a <i>RDF4J</i>-Triple-Store, a <i>Stardog</i>-Triple-Store or a <i>SPARQL</i>-Endpoint to get
						connected to.
					</p>
					<img th:src="@{images/connectForm.PNG}" class="helpImage" width="400">
					<p>
						After the connection attempt succeeded, the connection properties are to be refreshed and shown
						in the right upper corner.
					</p>
					<img th:src="@{images/connectStatus.PNG}" class="helpImage" width="300">
				</div>


				<div class="imageDiv">
					<h5>Searching for a term</h5>

					<p>To search the <i>RDF</i> triple store for a certain term you have to enter your search term in the
						search field on the <a href="explore">Explore</a> site.
						
					</p>
					<img th:src="@{images/exploreSearch.PNG}" class="helpImage" width="400">
					<p>
						You can choose between <strong>Simple</strong> and <strong>Broader Search</strong> whereas the first search method means that the
						result must exactly match the search term and the latter method means that the result must only
						contain the search term.
						<br>
						Therefore, <strong>Broader Search</strong> is case insensitive. However, the second search method requires much
						more time than the first one.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="imageDiv">
					<h5>Choosing a Starting Resource</h5>
					<p>
						After entering a search term a table with matching resources found in the triple store is drawn.
						<br>
						You have to choose one of the found resources by clicking on its "link" (<i>IRI</i>) in the first
						column.

					</p>
					<img th:src="@{images/exploreSearchResults.PNG}" class="helpImage" width="800">
					<p>
						After you have chosen a resource to begin the <i>RDF</i> Graph exploration with, you get another table
						with all database information that is linked to the chosen resource.

					</p>
					<img th:src="@{images/exploreSearchRessource.PNG}" class="helpImage" width="800">
					<p>
						In the bar under the information table you have the possibility to adjust some of the parameters
						of how the <i>RDF</i> data is going to be visualized.
						You can specify whether only the outgoing, incoming or both kind of edges of the graph nodes are
						to be shown in the simulation.
						<br>
						Furthermore you need to choose, which predicates to be visualized in the graph. Therefore you
						need to select a predicates list on the left side of the bar. If you want to modify the
						predicates list or create a new list you need to click on the <strong>Customize</strong> button.
						<br>
						After clicking the button a new table with all the different predicates of the connected Triple
						Store is drawn.
					</p>
					<img th:src="@{images/exploreSearchPredicates.PNG}" class="helpImage" width="800">
					<p>
						The predicates table consists of the three columns <strong>Predicate</strong>, <strong>Label</strong> and <strong>Edge</strong>. Under the
						<strong>Predicate</strong> column the identifier (<i>IRI</i>) of each predicate can be found. In both the other cells of
						each row a <strong>checkbox</strong> is set. If the the <strong>Label checkbox</strong> is checked the predicate of the row is
						going to determine the node label in the graph visualization. Only one checked <strong>Label checkbox</strong> in
						a predicate list is possible. If the <strong>Edge checkbox</strong> is checked the predicate is shown as an edge
						in the graph simulation in case the predicate is not connecting a node to a <i>RDF literal</i>.
						<br>
						By entering a list name and clicking on the <strong>Save</strong> button the predicates list will be overwritten
						or created anew.
						After saving the predicates list you will be led back to the start resource information table.
						By clicking the <strong>Explore</strong> button you can start the visualization.
					</p>

				</div>
				<div class="imageDiv">
					<h5>Exploring the RDF Graph</h5>
					<p>
						The visualization starts with the chosen starting node in the middle of the <strong>SVG</strong> element (white
						zoomable area).
					</p>
					<img th:src="@{images/exploreVisualisationIcons.PNG}" class="helpImage" width="400">
					<p>
						By hovering over the node, six different <strong>icons</strong> appear near the node, each with an other
						functionality.
					</p>
					<img th:src="@{images/nodeIcons.PNG}" class="helpImage" width="400">
					<p>

						<ul>
							<li>
								By clicking on the <strong>Expand</strong> icon the next relations of the node are visualized. Only 10 of
								such relations of a node are shown at the same time. If there are more than ten
								relations, you can click on the <strong>Expand</strong> icon for exposing the next 10 relations.
							</li>
							<li>
								The <strong>Offset</strong> number shows which amount of relations is currently visualized.
							</li>
							<li>
								You can remove a node from the simulation by clicking the <strong>Remove</strong> icon.

							</li>
							<li>
								By clicking the <strong>Info</strong> icon all information of the nodes resource are shown in an info
								box.
							</li>
							<li>A node stays always at the last position it is dragged to. But by clicking on the <strong>Unpin</strong>
								icon the nodes position is calculated according to the other nodes in the simulation and
								is automatically dragged to its new position.</li>
							<li>After a node appears in the simulation, it stays 10 further exploration units (clicks on
								nodes) on screen. To avoid the removal of certain nodes, they can be marked manually. By
								clicking on the <strong>Mark</strong> icon the node remains in the simulation until its end or after
								undoing the mark (clicking the icon another time).</li>
						</ul>
